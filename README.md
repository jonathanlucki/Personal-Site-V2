# Personal Website v2

This is the second version of my personal website. It is generated with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and made with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). It also features a homepage made with [Parallax.js](https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/).

### Customizing the Parallax
 
I have designed the site so that the parallax can be easily customized from the parallax.yml data file.  To add a parallax layer, all one must do is add a new item to the file, and provide a layer number, a depth number, and a path to the source image.

#### Update 23/05/19

It appears Parallax.js on some mobile devices has broken due to updates regarding motion/gyroscope preferences on several mobile browsers such as Safari and Chrome - will pay attention to this going forward.
